## Exercise 1: A Good First Program



```print ("Hello World!")
print ("Hello Again")
print ("I like typing this.")
print ("This is fun.")
print ('Yay! Printing.')
print ("I'd much rather you 'not'.")
print ('I "said" do not touch this.')
```

python3 使用 print（）要加括号

## Exercise 2: Comments and Pound Characters


```# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by python.

print ("I could have code like this.") # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# print "This won't run."

print ("This will run.")
```
## Exercise 3: Numbers and Math

```print ("I will now count my chickens:")

print ("Hens", 25 + 30 / 6)
print ("Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4)

print ("Now I will count the eggs:")

print (3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6)

print ("Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?")

print (3 + 2 < 5 - 7)

print ("What is 3 + 2?", 3 + 2)
print ("What is 5 - 7?", 5 - 7)

print ("Oh, that's why it's False.")

print ("How about some more.")

print ("Is it greater?", 5 > -2)
print ("Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= -2)
print ("Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2)
```

## Exercise 4: Variables And Names


```cars = 100
space_in_a_car = 4.0
drivers = 30
passengers = 90
cars_not_driven = cars - drivers
cars_driven = drivers
carpool_capacity = cars_driven * space_in_a_car
average_passengers_per_car = passengers / cars_driven

print ("There are", cars, "cars available.")

print ("There are only", drivers, "drivers available.")

print ("There will be", cars_not_driven, "empty cars today.")

print ("We can transport", carpool_capacity, "people today.")

print ("We have", passengers, "to carpool today.")

print ("We need to put about", 
average_passengers_per_car, "in each car.")
```

## Exercise 5: More Variables and Printing


```my_name = 'Zed A. Shaw'
my_age = 35 # not a lie
my_height = 74 # inches
my_weight = 180 # lbs
my_eyes = 'Blue'
my_teeth = 'White'
my_hair = 'Brown'

print ("Let's talk about %s." % my_name)
print ("He's %d inches tall." % my_height)
print ("He's %d pounds heavy." % my_weight)
print ("Actually that's not too heavy.")
print ("He's got %s eyes and %s hair." % (my_eyes, my_hair))
print ("His teeth are usually %s depending on the coffee." % my_teeth)

# this line is tricky, try to get it exactly right
print ("If I add %d, %d, and %d I get %d." % (
    my_age, my_height, my_weight, my_age + my_height + my_weight))
```
python3 使用 **Formatting Strings**要加在 print（）括号里面



## Exercise 6: Strings and Text


```x = "There are %d types of people." % 10
binary = "binary"
do_not = "don't"
y = "Those who know %s and those who %s." % (binary, do_not)

print (x)
print (y)

print ("I said: %r." % x)
print ("I also said: '%s'." % y)

hilarious = False
joke_evaluation = ("Isn't that joke so funny?! %r")

print (joke_evaluation % hilarious)

w = ("This is the left side of...")
e = ("a string with a right side.")

print (w + e)
```

## Exercise 7: More Printing


```print ("Mary had a little lamb.")
print ("Its fleece was white as %s." % 'snow')
print ("And everywhere that Mary went.")
print ("." * 10)  # what'd that do?

end1 = "C"
end2 = "h"
end3 = "e"
end4 = "e"
end5 = "s"
end6 = "e"
end7 = "B"
end8 = "u"
end9 = "r"
end10 = "g"
end11 = "e"
end12 = "r"

# watch that comma at the end.  try removing it to see what happens
print (end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6,)
print (end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12)
```

## Exercise 8: More Printing


```formatter = "%r %r %r %r"

print (formatter % (1, 2, 3, 4))
print (formatter % ("one", "two", "three", "four"))
print (formatter % (True, False, False, True))
print (formatter % (formatter, formatter, formatter, formatter))
print (formatter % (
    "I had this thing.",
    "That you could type up right.",
    "But it didn't sing.",
    "So I said goodnight."))
```


## Exercise 9: Printing, Printing, Printing


``` Here's some new strange stuff, remember type it exactly.

days = ("Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun")
months = ("Jan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug")

print ("Here are the days: ", days)
print ("Here are the months: ", months)

print (「」"
There's something going on here.
With the three double-quotes.
We'll be able to type as much as we like.
Even 4 lines if we want, or 5, or 6.
「」")
```

## Exercise 10: What Was That?


```tabby_cat = "\tI'm tabbed in."
persian_cat = "I'm split\non a line."
backslash_cat = "I'm \\ a \\ cat."

fat_cat = 「」"
I'll do a list:
\t* Cat food
\t* Fishies
\t* Catnip\n\t* Grass
「」"

print (tabby_cat)
print (persian_cat)
print (backslash_cat)
print (fat_cat)
```

## Exercise 11: Asking Questions


```age = input("How old are you?",)
height = input("How tall are you?",)
weight = input("How much do you weigh?")

print ("So, you're %r old, %r tall and %r heavy." % (
    age, height, weight))
    
```

## Exercise 12: Prompting People
#### 在python 3中 raw_input 和input合并了，所以练习同11



## Exercise 13: Parameters, Unpacking, Variables


```from sys import argv

first, second, third = argv

print ("The script is called:", script)
print ("Your first variable is:", first)
print ("Your second variable is:", second)
print ("Your third variable is:", third)

```

## Exercise 14: Parameters, Unpacking, Variables



```from sys import argv


user_name ="ex1.py"
prompt = '> '

print ("Hi %s, I'm the %s script." % (user_name, script))
print ("I'd like to ask you a few questions.")
print ("Do you like me %s?" % user_name)
likes = input(prompt)

print ("Where do you live %s?" % user_name)
lives = input(prompt)

print ("What kind of computer do you have?")
computer = input(prompt)

print (「」"
Alright, so you said %r about liking me.
You live in %r.  Not sure where that is.
And you have a %r computer.  Nice.
「」" % (likes, lives, computer))

```

## Exercise 15: Reading Files


```filename = "/Users/13space/NLP/ex1.py"

txt = open(filename)

print ("Here's your file %r:" % filename)
print (txt.read())

print ("Type the filename again:")
file_again = input("> ")

txt_again = open(file_again)

print (txt_again.read())
```


## Exercise 16: Reading and Writing Files


```filename = filename = "/Users/13space/NLP/ex100.py"

print ("We're going to erase %r." % filename)
print ("If you don't want that, hit CTRL-C (^C).")
print ("If you do want that, hit RETURN.")

input("?")

print ("Opening the file...")
target = open(filename, 'w')

print ("Truncating the file.  Goodbye!")
target.truncate()

print ("Now I'm going to ask you for three lines.")

line1 = input("line 1: ")
line2 = input("line 2: ")
line3 = input("line 3: ")

print ("I'm going to write these to the file.")

target.write(line1)
target.write("\n")
target.write(line2)
target.write("\n")
target.write(line3)
target.write("\n")

print ("And finally, we close it.")
target.close()
```
## Exercise 17: More Files


```from_file = "/Users/13space/NLP/ex1.py"
to_file = "/Users/13space/NLP/ex100.py"

print ("Copying from %s to %s" % (from_file, to_file))

# we could do these two on one line, how?
in_file = open(from_file)
indata = in_file.read()

print ("The input file is %d bytes long" % len(indata))

print ("Does the output file exist? %r" % exists(to_file))
print ("Ready, hit RETURN to continue, CTRL-C to abort.")
input()

out_file = open(to_file, 'w')
out_file.write(indata)

print ("Alright, all done.")

out_file.close()
in_file.close()

```
